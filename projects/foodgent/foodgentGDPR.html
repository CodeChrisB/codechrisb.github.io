                    (1) As of now this will not happen but if we decide to do it we, have the rights to do it.<br>

                    (2) As of now this will not happen and will probably never be the case, but we just want to <br>
                    make sure that we leave us a backdoor if we ever see a possible and ethical way to use your<br>
                    Data in a way like this.<br><br>

                    (3) We are not quite sure how we will use your data, so we can not give you further information
